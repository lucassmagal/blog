Legal quando a gente encontra um link bacana enquanto navegamos à toa.
Este aqui aborda um tema que muito me interessa, *compiladores*. A ideia é:
você quer aprender a escrever um compilador, compra um desses livros
famosos e se decepciona. Segue um trecinho do artigo (que já é bem pequeno):

> It's not that they're bad books, they're just too broadly scoped, and the
> authors present so much information that it's hard to know where to begin.
> Some books are better than others, but there are still the thick chapters
> about converting regular expressions into executable state machines and
> different types of grammars and so on. After slogging through it all you
> will have undoubtedly expanded your knowledge, but you're no closer to
> actually writing a working compiler.
>
> Not surprisingly, the opaqueness of these books has led to the myth that
> compilers are hard to write.
